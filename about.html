    <p style="text-indent: 5em">UCLA Translate Flashcards will assist users in accomplishing their goal in learning phrases that they find valuable in another language. What makes UCLA Translate Flashcards different from other existing flashcard resources is that it is tailored to meet the individual needs of each and every user. Rather than generating a generic list of commonly translated phrases between two languages, UCLA Translate Flashcards will take the phrases that the user saves to their Phrasebook, and creates a personalized set of flashcards from this input. </p>
    
	<p style="text-indent: 5em">To interact with their flashcards, the user can update them: add, delete, categorize, modify, and rank each card’s difficulty. In addition, the user can input to UCLA Translate Flashcards a list of phrases they would like the application to translate and make the flashcards for them. Further, a user can organize their decks of flashcards by language, context, topic, or however they so desire. </p>
    
	<p style="text-indent: 5em">Through spaced repetition, the user does not just learn these phrases – they are committed to memory. To accomplish this, UCLA Translate Flashcards provides users with the ability to test their knowledge, assess the areas they need to focus on more through progress bars, and feel confident in the areas that they have mastered.</p>
